\usage{
srvf_to_f(q, time, f0 = NULL, multidimensional = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{Either a numeric vector of a numeric matrix or a numeric array
specifying the SRSFs that need to be transformed.
\itemize{
\item If a vector, it must be of shape \eqn{M} and it is interpreted as a
single \eqn{1}-dimensional curve observed on a grid of size \eqn{M}.
\item If a matrix and \code{multidimensional == FALSE}, it must be of shape
\eqn{M \times N}. In this case, it is interpreted as a sample of \eqn{N}
curves observed on a grid of size \eqn{M}, unless \eqn{M = 1} in which case
it is interpreted as a single \eqn{1}-dimensional curve observed on a grid
of size \eqn{M}.
\item If a matrix and \code{multidimensional == TRUE},it must be of shape
\eqn{L \times M} and it is interpreted as a single \eqn{L}-dimensional
curve observed on a grid of size \eqn{M}.
\item If a 3D array, it must be of shape \eqn{L \times M \times N} and it is
interpreted as a sample of \eqn{N} \eqn{L}-dimensional curves observed on a
grid of size \eqn{M}.
}}

\item{time}{A numeric vector of length \eqn{M} specifying the grid on which
SRSFs are evaluated.}

\item{f0}{Either a numeric value or a numeric vector of or a numeric matrix
specifying the initial value of the curves in the original functional
space. It must be:
\itemize{
\item a value if \code{q} represents a single \eqn{1}-dimensional SRSF.
\item a vector of length \eqn{L} if \code{q} represents a single
\eqn{L}-dimensional SRSF.
\item a vector of length \eqn{N} if \code{q} represents a sample of \eqn{N}
\eqn{1}-dimensional SRSFs.
\item a matrix of shape \eqn{L \times M} if \code{q} represents a sample of \eqn{N}
\eqn{L}-dimensional  SRSFs.
}}

\item{multidimensional}{A boolean specifying if the curves are
multi-dimensional. This is useful when \code{q} is provided as a matrix to
determine whether it is a single multi-dimensional curve or a collection of
uni-dimensional curves. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A numeric array of the same shape as the input \code{q} storing the
transformation of the SRSFs \code{q} back to the original functional space.
}
\description{
This function transforms SRVFs back to the original functional space.
